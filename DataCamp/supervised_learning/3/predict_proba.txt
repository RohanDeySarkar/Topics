predict_proba(X)

Probability estimates.

The returned estimates for all classes are ordered by the label of classes.

Parameters:	
X : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features]

Returns:	
T : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_classes]
Returns the probability of the sample for each class in the model, where classes are ordered as they are in self.classes_.
